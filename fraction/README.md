```clojure
[cljsjs/fraction "4.0.12-1"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require cljsjs.fraction))
```

Fraction is a rational number library written in JavaScript.

Tired of inprecise numbers represented by doubles, which have to store rational
and irrational numbers like PI or sqrt(2) the same way? Obviously the following
problem is preventable:

```javascript
1 / 98 * 98 // = 0.9999999999999999
```

If you need more precision or just want a fraction as a result, have a look at
*Fraction.js*:

```javascript
var Fraction = require('fraction.js');

Fraction(1).div(98).mul(98) // = 1
```

Internally, numbers are represented as *numerator / denominator*, which adds
just a little overhead. However, the library is written with performance in mind
and outperforms any other implementation, as you can see [here][benchmark]. This
basic data-type makes it the perfect basis for [Polynomial.js][polyjs] and
[Math.js][mathjs].
